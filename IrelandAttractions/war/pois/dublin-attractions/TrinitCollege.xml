        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>Trinity is the oldest university in Ireland and one of the oldest in the world. It is also 
			home to one of the most famous Irish books: The Book of Kells, an old religious manuscript, famous for 
			the beautiful writing and decorations.</p>
			<p>In the same building housing The Book of Kells you can find one of the most beautiful libraries in the 
			world. Its initial purpose was to gather one copy of every existing book, a manageable task 200 years ago,
			but now any more.</p>
			<p>I really like walking around the campus and I think I would have liked being a student here.</p>
