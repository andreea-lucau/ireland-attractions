        <title>Guiness Storehouse</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>Guiness is the trademark of the city. A lot of the postcards have the image of the Guiness factory.
			The storehouse is located in an old part of the factory, transformed into a modern museum. The ticket can be booked 
			online and you can avoid the long queues. Plan for around 2 hours. The tour takes you through the process of making 
			beer and it ends in a round glass bar that offers a nice view of the city.</p>
			<p>The price of the ticket includes a free beer. Before leaving, checkout the cafeteria: everything there is made 
			with Guiness. My favourite are the Guiness bear with the Guiness stew.</p>
