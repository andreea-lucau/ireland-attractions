			<p>This is one of my favourite areas in Dublin. This is where the Celtic Tiger rose and changed
			the city: there are a lot of new and modern buildings in the area, nice restaurants and a very fancy 
			theather: Bord Gais Energy Theather.</p>
			<p>I had brunch here a few times and the area just looks amazing in the morning, it fills you up with energy
			and you are ready for a new day.</p>
