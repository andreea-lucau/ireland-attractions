        <title>Phoenix Park</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>This is the biggest park in Europe. I would recommend a visit at the zoo, then a nice tea or cake. 
			There is a bike rental close to the park entrance and I think a bike is the best way to explore the park.</p>
			<p>The American ambassador has a huge mansion in the middle of the park, similar looking to the white house. 
			The Irish prime minister also has a house here. Another famous resident of the park are a bunch of deers, make sure not 
			to miss them.</p>
