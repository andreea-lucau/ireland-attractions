        <title>Glenveagh Castle</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>This castle is situated literally in the middle of nowhere: it is by a lake, in a middle of a national 
			park. The castle was the properly of several gentlemen, all of them know as one of the richest people in the world 
			in their time. With all that money, they arranged a little piece of heaven in Ireland. Now it is the property of the 
			state and everybody can have a peak into the life of the rich.</p>
			<p>The castle is situated in the middle of an estate and to get there, you could either take a bus or rent a bike. I 
			would recommend the bike: the road is easy and also you can bike from the castle to a small waterfall 4 kilometers
			away.</p>
