        <title>Cliffs of Moher</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>This has to be the most windy but visited place in Ireland. 60 kilometers from Galway, the cliffs are 
			raising from the ocean and are not a good place for people who are afraid of hights.</p>
			<p>200 meters from the cliffs there is a visitor centre, where you can eat and basically hide from the wind.
			There is also a parking lot, that is free. </p>
