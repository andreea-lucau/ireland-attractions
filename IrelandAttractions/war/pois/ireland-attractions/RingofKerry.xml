        <title>Ring of Kerry</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>Ring of Kerry is actually a tour of o peninsula dipping in the Atlantic ocean. First stop is Ross 
			castle. Close to the castle there is a huge lake, where there are the ruins of an ancient Irish monastery. If you 
			are lucky, you will see one of the inhabitans of the island: wild deers.</p>
			<p>Next stop is Muckross house, an elegant mansion in a middle of a park and facing a lake. The drive will continue 
			along the shore. The route is called The Wild Atlantic Way. Another interesting stop is Skelling Michael, an island 
			rising sharp from the ocean. The bad part is that it takes one hours long boat ride to get there and if the weather 
			is windy... the breakfast might not stay in your stomach. One thousand years ago the island was inhabited by monks 
			that build here stone houses, now called beahives.</p>
