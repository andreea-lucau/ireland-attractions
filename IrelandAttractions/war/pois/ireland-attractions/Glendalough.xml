        <title>Glendalough</title>
        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>Glendalough might be my favorite village in Ireland.This tinny village is 
        	situated in the Wiclow mountains. The village itself has an ancient cemetery
        	and a church with one of those huge Irish stone round towers.
        	They don't make it anymore Irish then this.</p>
			<p>Two kilometers away from the village there are two lakes, a waterfall and 
			a beautiful glacial valley.There are parking lots by the lakes and places to 
			have a picnic. I would book a full day for the lakes, the valley and the 
			monastery.</p>
