        <description><![CDATA[
        	<p>This is currently my favourite restaurant in Dublin! I never had thai food before coming to 
			Dublin and before going to this restaurant I had the fast food version of thai food and it was good, but
			this place is heaven. First, you get on the house some delicius thai chips and then the food is delicious
			and I always have some to go, because it is just too much for me to finish in one go.</p>
