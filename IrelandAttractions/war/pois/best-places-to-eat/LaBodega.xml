        	<p>I love the idea of tapas: small bites to eat and people sharing food. Bodega is perfect for
			this. It offers you traditional and delicious Spanish tapas and the best way to experience is by going
			with a group of friends and tasting as many tapas as possible.</p>
			<p>Their desserts are amazing as well and one time we were recommended a very good a wine to go with the
			dessert - one of the most sweet and delicious drinks that I ever tasted.</p>
