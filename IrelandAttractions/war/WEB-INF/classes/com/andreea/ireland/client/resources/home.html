<h2>Ireland Attractions</h2>

<p>The republic of Ireland is known for several things: the green field, the rainy weather, the Guiness beer,
the rugby tradition, the English domination, the red hair and freckles (yes, I'm talking about the gingers).
Because of the good things and despite of the bad, there are always tourists here. I've gathered some of the
things I like about Ireland and Dublin and I think visitors might enjoy.</p>

<p>Here are some good-to-know things before coming here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ireland is a member of the European Union</li>
	<li>the official language is Irish, but people speak English</li>
	<li>the currency in Ireland is EURO</li>
	<li>the cars have the wheel on the left</li>
	<li>the country roads are very narrow</li>
</ul>
